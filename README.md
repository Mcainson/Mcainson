### Hi there 👋
- 👩🏿‍💻 I am a web developer from Haiti living in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
- ⚡ I like to do things with PHP, Python and Javascript.
- 😍 I am also in love with Laravel and Vue JS.
- ⚡ These days, I started reading algorithm books again, just to improve my coding skills and refresh what I had already learned in college.
